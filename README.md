**Authors**: Riccardo Guidotti, Francesco Spinnato

## Installation

We suggest to create a new environment using `conda`. You can create a new environment by running the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Then, you can activate the environment by running the following command:

```bash
conda activate 2025_phd_ts_course
```


An alternative, if you already have a working environment you can install the required packages listed in the file `requirements.txt` by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This may fail, depending on your system.

## Usage
Notebooks are in the folder `notebooks`. You can run them by running the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

The data necessary to run the notebooks is in the folder `notebooks/data`.
